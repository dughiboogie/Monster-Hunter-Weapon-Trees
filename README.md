# Monster Hunter Weapon Trees

This project is a recreation of the Weapon Trees UI inside the Monster Hunter games.
The goal of the project is to have a fully interactable UI that lets the user make all the common CRUD operations (e.g. Add/remove weapon trees, add/remove/update weapon entries, etc.).

The only weapon type that this app will cover is the Gun Lance, but in the future it could be extended to support every type of weapon.
The weapon trees are grouped by game, as some statistics multipliers are game-specific.
